# Research Environments for Computational Biomedical Science

This repository documents reproducible computational environments used for
biomedical, cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and machine learning research.

## Scope
- Reproducible Python environments using conda / mamba
- Environment version pinning for scientific rigor
- Foundations for RDKit, molecular simulations, and ML workflows
- Designed for transparency, reuse, and long-term maintenance

## Motivation
Modern biomedical research depends critically on computational reproducibility.
This repository serves as a living record of environment design decisions that
support reliable, verifiable scientific results.

## Status
Active development. Environments will evolve as new tools are evaluated and
validated.
