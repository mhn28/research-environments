# Cover Letter

Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled  
**“A Reproducible RDKit-Based Cheminformatics-to-QSAR Pipeline with Transparent Feature Engineering”**  
for consideration in your journal.

The present work describes a fully reproducible and version-controlled
computational framework that integrates RDKit-based molecular descriptor
calculation with baseline QSAR modeling. The primary objective of this study
is methodological: to demonstrate transparent descriptor generation,
feature filtering, and interpretable model construction within a rigorously
documented software environment.

All analyses were performed using a pinned conda/micromamba environment on
a Linux platform, ensuring long-term reproducibility. Descriptor computation,
statistical preprocessing, model training, and evaluation were executed
using openly available tools, and all intermediate datasets and scripts are
tracked via Git version control.

Importantly, this study does not aim to optimize predictive performance for
a specific biological endpoint. Instead, it provides a reference workflow
that may serve as a reliable foundation for future cheminformatics, QSAR,
and machine-learning studies in medicinal chemistry and related disciplines.

We confirm that this manuscript represents original work, has not been
published previously, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors
have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission.

We believe the emphasis on computational transparency, reproducibility,
and methodological clarity will be of interest to the readership of your
journal.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Mohin Sapara  
Computational Biomedical Researcher
