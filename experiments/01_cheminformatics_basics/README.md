# Experiment 01: Cheminformatics Foundations with RDKit

## Objective
Establish a reproducible baseline experiment using RDKit to:
- Parse small molecules
- Compute physicochemical descriptors
- Perform basic statistical summaries

## Scientific Rationale
Cheminformatics descriptors form the quantitative bridge between molecular structure
and biological, pharmacological, and toxicological behavior. This experiment serves
as a controlled foundation for downstream QSAR, docking, and ML workflows.

## Reproducibility
- Environment: conda (research.yaml)
- Platform: Ubuntu 24.04
- RDKit via conda-forge
- Deterministic descriptor computation

## Status
Scaffold initialized. Code and results to follow.
