# Table Legends

**Table 1. Molecular descriptor definitions.**  
Summary of physicochemical descriptors computed using RDKit, including
descriptor name, definition, and units where applicable.

**Table 2. Filtered descriptor matrix.**  
Final set of molecular descriptors retained after removal of zero-variance
and highly correlated features. Values shown after preprocessing and scaling.

**Table 3. QSAR dataset partitioning.**  
Number of molecules allocated to training and test sets, along with summary
statistics of descriptor distributions.

**Table 4. Linear QSAR model performance metrics.**  
Model performance evaluated using coefficient of determination (R²), root mean
squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) for training and test sets.

**Table 5. Linear QSAR regression coefficients.**  
Estimated regression coefficients for retained descriptors in the baseline
linear QSAR model, indicating direction and magnitude of association.
