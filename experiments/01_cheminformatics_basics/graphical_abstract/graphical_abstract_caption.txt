Graphical Abstract.
Overview of the reproducible cheminformatics-to-QSAR workflow.
Small molecules encoded as SMILES are processed using RDKit to compute
physicochemical descriptors, followed by variance-based feature filtering,
scaling, and baseline QSAR modeling. All steps are executed in a pinned
computational environment with full version control.
